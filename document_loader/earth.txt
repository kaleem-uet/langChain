Whispers of the Earth**

Beneath a sky of endless hue,
Where clouds drift soft in shades of blue,
The meadows breathe a gentle sigh,
As wild birds etch the morning sky.

The sun, a brush of golden flame,
Paints dawn’s embrace with no acclaim,
And every leaf and every tree
Becomes a page of poetry.

The rivers sing a silver song,
To hills that hum and roll along,
While blossoms bloom with fragrant grace,
A smile upon the planet’s face.

The forest speaks in winds that weave
Through branches dressed in emerald leaves,
And quiet paths where moss has grown
Feel like the Earth’s heart carved in stone.

Oh nature, tender, fierce, and free,
You are life’s purest symphony—
A sacred dance of earth and air,
Of water’s tears and fire’s flare.

Let us not blind our eyes to see
The timeless gift of harmony,
For in your breath, so wild and true,
Lies all the love we ever knew.
